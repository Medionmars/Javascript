// This are just basic math commands you are also able to add two string togheter like dog + cat is catdog in 1 string

var t = 20 % 2, y = 19 % 2;

// Here you can check the remainers so the .0 after a number and with the === at the end you can ask 
// if the remainers is for example you can do this with variables that are a int or float you could aslo do it with string
